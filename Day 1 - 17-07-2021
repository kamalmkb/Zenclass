Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP 1.1 was introduced in 1997, it loads resources one after another, so if one resource cannot be loaded it blocks all the other resources behind it.
It keeps all requeats and responses in the plain text format.

HTTP 2.0 was introduced in 2015, it can use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks the other.
It uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format.
